-UPDATE-
AWS is stopping support of python 2.7 as of the 1/1/2020
As this project is run on python 2.7 the project will become unsupported by the platform.
This will lead to the skill not working.
For current users the skill will still work till February.
In the meantime I am working on a new version with video support.
